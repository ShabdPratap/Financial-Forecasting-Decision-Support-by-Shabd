# Financial-Forecasting-Decision-Support-by-Shabd

This submission presents an end-to-end financial forecasting and decision-support analysis built entirely in Microsoft Excel using historical monthly sales and cost data.

I developed an ARIMA-based time series forecast to estimate future sales trends and evaluated its reliability using standard accuracy metrics (MAPE and RMSE). The forecast was then used as an input for scenario analysis to understand how changes in sales assumptions impact overall profitability.

To support practical budgeting decisions, I implemented Excel Data Tables to assess profit sensitivity under multiple sales scenarios and used Goal Seek to determine the sales increase required to achieve a predefined profit target. The analysis highlights the relationship between revenue growth and profitability and provides clear, actionable insights for budget planning.

The Excel workbook is structured to clearly separate data preparation, modeling, validation, scenario analysis, and decision outputs, making the results easy to interpret for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
